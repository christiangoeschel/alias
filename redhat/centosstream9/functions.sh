# Useful functions for a smoother system administration

# A lot of terminals still do not support colors and therefore it can be a little tedious to manually check 
# a given items file type. 
# The -F option for the 'ls' command will append the following symbols to the corresponding file types:
# 
# /        directories
# @        symbolic links
# *        executables
# |        FIFOs ( a.k.a named pipes )
# =        sockets
# >        doors ( currently only implemented on Solaris )
# none     regular file
